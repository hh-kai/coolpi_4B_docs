## 简介

RK3588-s contains three NPU cores with processing performance up to 6T.
The three cores of NPU support three application scenarios: three-core cooperation, dual-core cooperation and independent work.
It can effectively deal with multi-task and multi-scenario parallel application scenarios. At the same time, it also supports mainstream deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow, Tflite, Python, Onnx, etc.
