# CoolPI-4B Development Docs

English | [简体中文](./README_CN.md)

## Introduce

Dear developers, we are the development team of CoolPI.
CoolPI Forum is an open and inclusive community, bringing together developers from many countries. 
Developers use different languages to communicate in the forum, causing communication obstacles.
In order to facilitate your development, our engineers have released a large number of documents in the community.
Due to limited time, these documents are usually mixed with Chinese and English, which hinders developers from quickly getting started with the development board.
In order to solve this problem, we specially set up this warehouse to record some common problems encountered during the development of CoolPI-4B.
I hope this warehouse can help you quickly get started with the CoolPI-4B development board.
